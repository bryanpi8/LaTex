\section{Deliverables}
Given the short timeframe of a semester, and excluding a lot of work that is going to be done I have honed in on two main deliverables.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1-2 more PicoBalloon launches
    \item A fully tested and working V1 DeSCENT \begin{enumerate}
        \item Or a breadboarded and tested V2 chipsat
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

While there will be plenty of work outside these deliverables taking place over the course of the semester, these are what I believe are good milestones.
