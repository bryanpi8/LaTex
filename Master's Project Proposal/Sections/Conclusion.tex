\section{Conclusion}
Though time is extremely limited there is significant work and progress that can be made on both described systems, including the PicoBalloon project. With launches slated for next semester a majority of work must be completed this semester. Projects will continue into V2 or even new project opportunities next semester. With that being said this is a perfect opportunity for me to learn what goes into space systems design and learn the specific techniques used in this design space, all while providing my own expertise to the group.
